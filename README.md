# java.demo.fun_with_composition
Similar to kotlin.demo.fun_with_composition. It shows that Java does not make it as easy as Kotlin when it comes to function composition.

Nothing to serious here.
But it does show that function composition is more difficult in Java than in KOTLIN.
Note that this based on two wonderful books by Pierre-Yves Saumont:
* Functional Programming in Java
* Joy of Kotlin
